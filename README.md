## Health Tech 📱💉
(Problem Statement - 6)

Getting a proper health facility is a dream for all. Not all government hospitals have good facilities, equipment, or
experienced staff to take care of the people of that city. This issue can be resolved if all the government hospitals work 
collaboratively and ensure good facilities are provided to all. For example, consider in a small town, a government 
hospital does not have the equipment to treat the patient. So, the hospital referred that patient to a more equipped 
government hospital near to the city. Now the patient feels helpless to go to the referred government hospital and 
explain his/her illness, as they now must follow the same procedure as followed before in the small-town government 
hospital to get information about the illness like going through the same tests, same checkups, etc.
So, you have to create a prototype that solves the issues mentioned above.
